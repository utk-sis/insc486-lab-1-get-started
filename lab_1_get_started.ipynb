Like most labs and assignment in this course, all of the files for this lab are contained in a single GitHub repository (i.e., a collection of files hosted on GitHub's servers).  Assignments are set up using \"template\" repositories.  The idea is that these templates for each lab will provide a framework for you to work with.  Your job is to follow each lab's instructions and fill in the missing pieces of code and/or text.\n",
